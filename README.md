## Notes of this project
The code originates from our research project and the aim is to demonstrate the research idea, so we have not optimized it from a product perspective. And we will spend time to address some common issues, such as out of memory issue, limited resolution, but will not involve too much in engineering problems, such as speedup of the inference, fastapi deployment and so on. We welcome volunteers to contribute to this project to make it more usable for practical application.

## New
You can now play with our [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NEm6AsybIiC5TwTU_4DqDkQO0nFRB-uA?usp=sharing) and try it on your photos. 

## Requirement
The code is tested on Ubuntu with Nvidia GPUs and CUDA installed. Python>=3.6 is required to run the code.

## Installation

Clone the Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch repository for

```
cd Face_Enhancement/models/networks/
git clone https://github.com/vacancy/Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch
cp -rf Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch/sync_batchnorm .
cd ../../../
```

```
cd Global/detection_models
git clone https://github.com/vacancy/Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch
cp -rf Synchronized-BatchNorm-PyTorch/sync_batchnorm .
cd ../../
```

Download the landmark detection pretrained model

```
cd Face_Detection/
wget http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
bzip2 -d shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
cd ../
```

Download the pretrained model from Azure Blob Storage, put the file `Face_Enhancement/checkpoints.zip` under `./Face_Enhancement`, and put the file `Global/checkpoints.zip` under `./Global`. Then unzip them respectively.

```
cd Face_Enhancement/
wget https://facevc.blob.core.windows.net/zhanbo/old_photo/pretrain/Face_Enhancement/checkpoints.zip
unzip checkpoints.zip
cd ../
cd Global/
wget https://facevc.blob.core.windows.net/zhanbo/old_photo/pretrain/Global/checkpoints.zip
unzip checkpoints.zip
cd ../
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use?

**Note**: GPU can be set 0 or 0,1,2 or 0,2; use -1 for CPU

### 1) Full Pipeline

You could easily restore the old photos with one simple command after installation and downloading the pretrained model.

For images without scratches:

```
python run.py --input_folder [test_image_folder_path] \
              --output_folder [output_path] \
              --GPU 0
```

For scratched images:

```
python run.py --input_folder [test_image_folder_path] \
              --output_folder [output_path] \
              --GPU 0 \
              --with_scratch
```

Note: Please try to use the absolute path. The final results will be saved in `./output_path/final_output/`. You could also check the produced results of different steps in `output_path`.

### 2) Scratch Detection

Currently we don't plan to release the scratched old photos dataset with labels directly. If you want to get the paired data, you could use our pretrained model to test the collected images to obtain the labels.

```
cd Global/
python detection.py --test_path [test_image_folder_path] \
                    --output_dir [output_path] \
                    --input_size [resize_256|full_size|scale_256]
```

### 3) Global Restoration

A triplet domain translation network is proposed to solve both structured degradation and unstructured degradation of old photos.

</p>

```
cd Global/
python test.py --Scratch_and_Quality_restore \
               --test_input [test_image_folder_path] \
               --test_mask [corresponding mask] \
               --outputs_dir [output_path]

python test.py --Quality_restore \
 --test_input [test_image_folder_path] \
 --outputs_dir [output_path]
```

### 4) Face Enhancement

We use a progressive generator to refine the face regions of old photos. More details could be found in our journal submission and `./Face_Enhancement` folder.

> *NOTE*: 
> This repo is mainly for research purpose and we have not yet optimized the running performance. 
> 
> Since the model is pretrained with 256*256 images, the model may not work ideally for arbitrary resolution.

## To Do
- [x] Clean testing code
- [x] Release pretrained model
- [x] Collab demo
- [ ] Replace face detection module (dlib) with RetinaFace
